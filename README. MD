Car Rental System

Introduction:

A car rental system is a software application that allows users

to rent vehicles from a car rental company. The system can be

implemented using an object-oriented programming language

such as Java. The system will typically have classes for

representing car, customers and rental agency, and implement functions such as calculating rental fees,

checking vehicle availability, and processing payments.

MODULES:
1.Car:
the car class models a car available for rent. 

It encapsulates information about the car, such as its ID, model, brand, rental price per day, and rental status.

2.Customer:
the customer class models a customer who rents cars from the agency. 

It contains personal information about the customer, as well as details of any car they have rented.

3.The rental agency:
the rental agency class represents the main system that manages the cars and customers, and facilitates rental transactions. 

It holds a list of all cars and customers in the system and provides methods to manage these entities.

CONCLUSION:
This Car Rental System project is built using the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming. 

It encapsulates the functionality of a real-world rental agency and supports easy future enhancements. 

Comprehensive testing ensures system reliability and accuracy in handling car rentals and customer management.
